## General Information (Read before playing)
It's complicated, it's a work in progress, but it is _kinda_ stable. I try to break as little as possible.
#### Other Actor Sheet Plans
Originally I planned on making a Grunt sheet, but quickly found myself just expanding on the Character sheet. At the moment, there is no plan for a Grunt sheet.
- Vehicle sheet is my next planned sheet. 
- Host, IC, Spirits, and Sprites are planned.
